```lua
 
--- This Will Only Work In A Local Script

local mouse = game.Players.LocalPlayer:GetMouse() --- Gets Players Mouse

--- Now we want to print the position 

local x,y,z = mouse.Hit.X,mouse.Hit.Y,mouse.Hit.Z 

print(x,y,z)

---Output: Xpos,Ypos,Zpos
```
 Now lets make a part move with the players mouse.

```lua
local RunService = game:GetService ("RunService")

 local newpart = instance.new("Part",game.Workspace) ---Creates new part

newpart.Size = Vector3.new(5,5,5) ---Self explanatory 

local mouse = game.Players.LocalPlayer:GetMouse() --- Gets Players Mouse

local x,y,z = mouse.Hit.X,mouse.Hit.Y,mouse.Hit.Z 

--- Mouse.Target tells you what base part your hovering

if mouse.Target == newpart then --- checking if the mouse is hovering the part
 RunService.RenderStepped:Connect(function() --- A friendlier while true do

newpart.Position = Vector3.new(x,y/game.Workspace.Baseplate.Postion,z)


   end)

end

```
